# Machine Learning for Used Car Price Prediction

# Overview
Machine Learning is widely used in various industries worldwide, and the automobile and consultancy business is no exception. This repository hosts a study that explores the application of Machine Learning algorithms to predict the prices of used cars. As cars age and are resold as used, their pricing is influenced by supply and demand, as well as their specific set of features and unique history. Traditional methods struggle to accurately evaluate the value of a vehicle when it possesses uncommon features. This study aims to demonstrate how Machine Learning algorithms can better utilize data on less common features to assess the value of used cars.

# Objective
The primary objective of this project is to compare the performance of various Machine Learning regression algorithms in predicting the price of used cars. The algorithms under consideration are:

- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Support Vector Regression
- Decision Tree Regression
- KNeighborsRegressor
- CatBoostRegressor
- Random Forest Regression

# Dataset
The dataset used for this study is a publicly available collection of used car listings. It includes information about various car attributes such as make, model, year, features, mileage, and price. The dataset is preprocessed and cleaned to ensure reliable results.
Results
The study's results, including performance metrics and comparisons of the various regression algorithms, are available in the results directory. The conclusion is based on the performance of the CatBoostRegressor and Random Forest Regression algorithms, which demonstrated the highest price prediction accuracy across all evaluation metrics.

# Conclusion
Machine Learning plays a crucial role in improving the assessment of used car prices, particularly for vehicles with less common features. This study shows that CatBoostRegressor and Random Forest Regression are reliable choices for predicting used car prices, providing valuable insights for businesses in the automobile and consultancy sectors.
